/**
 * A text based dungeon game with different enemies based on player-level
 * The game also has 3 different bosses at level 10, 20 and 30
 * The combat is turn-based where the player always go first
 * The player can enter a shop to buy items to become stronger
 * During combat, the player can decide to flee which has a small chance, however you won't have to fight the same enemy again
 * Another way to earn money is by going to the casino and test your luck
